# Variables and Data Types

* Java must declare a variable type with name
* Variable names are case sensitive
* A variable name can start with a valid letter, or a `$`, or a `_`.
    * no number or other special characters
* Common naming convention: camelCase

```java
int age;
double salarayRequirement;
boolean isEmployed;
```

## Data Types (Primitive)
* `int`: between 2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 (0 to 2^32)
* `doubles`: max 1.797,693,134,862,315,7 E+308, min 4.9 E-324
* `boolean`: `true` or `false`
* `char`: can hold any charcter, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark, using single quote `'`
* `byte`:
* `long`:
* `short`:
* `float`: 
* `null`: only can store `null`
```java 
    float k = (float)12.5;
```

## Data Types (Non-Primitives)
* These are `Objects` and they have built-in behavior
* `String`: 

## Static Checking
* static typing: Java won't compile if variable is assinged to an incorrect type
    * this will cause error during compile time
